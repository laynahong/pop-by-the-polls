              <h3>Gun Reform</h3>
              <p>
                Mass shootings in the United States have caused Democrats to
                push for stricter gun regulations and reforms. On the other
                hand, Republicans invoke the Second Amendment right to bear
                arms, also pointing out that guns might be needed for
                self-defense.

              <h3>Abortion</h3>
              <p>
                The Trump Administration and Republicans continue to try to
                criminalize abortions on social and religious basis. On the
                other hand, Democrats are pushing a more pro-choice agenda,
                reiterating that abortion is a personal choice.

              <h3>Immigration</h3>
              <p>
                Immigration has also been a hot topic within national politics.
                While both parties agree on curbing illegal migration into the
                country, Democrats support making it easier for immigrants to
                become legal citizens, while Republicans want to restrict
                immigration all together.

              <h3>Healthcare</h3>
              <p>
                Affordable healthcare is an important issue for Democrats, who
                want to expand the Affordable Health Care Act passed under the
                Obama Administration. Opponents of expanding Medicare argue
                against higher taxes.
